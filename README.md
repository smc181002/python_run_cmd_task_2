these are the files which can be hosted in your apache httpd software

To use this make sure you have done these steps:
* edit the sudoers file to give permissions to apache user to edit files to get it's full experience
* write selinux permissions or just set the selinux to permissive state 
* make sure the firewall in your system allows 80 port so that the portal is available for the outside world

I am going to create docker container soon so directly use it
